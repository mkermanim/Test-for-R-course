# Introduction

It is my _first_ Markdown practice. I am going to practice some of __Markdown__ functions in this file. 
Firdt, I am going to read a file that contains all of coded tweets of my PhD project.
``` {r reading file, eval=  FALSE}
coded_tweets <- readxl::read_xlsx("C:/Users/Hossein/Dropbox/Academic/PHD/Dissertation/Data and Analyses/Coding/Coders/Final Round!/AllFinalTwettsCoded/final_codes.xlsx")
```
After reading data, I am going to have a `glimpse()` on my file. Thus, here is a summary of my file.
```{r looking at data, eval=FALSE}
dplyr:: glimpse(coded_tweets)
```
Now lets see wht happens!
